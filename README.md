# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code

Purpose: For users to add important events to a daily planner to help them manage their time. 

REMOVE THIS LATER ---
TO DO:
Use a daily planner to create a schedule. 
When you open the planner, the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.
When you scroll down, there are time blocks for standard business hours. 9:00-6:00.
Each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future. 
    -Red indicated past
    -Blue indicates present
    -Green indicates future.
When you click on a time block, you can enter an event into that block. 
The text for that event is saved into local storage. 
When you refresh the page, then the saved events stay there.
